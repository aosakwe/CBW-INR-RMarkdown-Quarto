## Premise

This report aims to provide core summary statistics for breast cancer patient data collected at the University of Wisconsin. The data comprises multiple quantitative attributes for benign and malignant samples. Results of this script will be updated as patient data is collected.

## Load Libraries

```{r, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

#QUESTION: why would we set message and warning to false here?
```

## Load Data

```{r}
#Loading full dataset.
df <- read.csv('./breast_cancer_v1.csv')
```

```{r}
#Loading descriptions for column names
meta_df <- readRDS('./meta.rds')
meta_df
```

## Summary Statistics

```{r}
#TODO Create a data frame storing the summary statistics for each column in df




#####

#TODO print out the created data frame


#Hint: min(), mean(), median(), max() and quantile() are all functions in R use ? to check their usage
```

## Clinical Variable Visualization

```{r}

#Observing correlation between Cell size and shape
ggplot(df,aes(x = Cell.size,
              y = Cell.shape)) +
  geom_point()
## TODO Update the function to color by sample Class!
## Update the labels and add a title (hint: labs())
```

```{r}
#Box plots for Cell siZe and shape
ggplot(df, aes(y = Cell.size)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
## TODO
# Recreate the previous plots but visualize malignant and benign samples separately so that they can be compared

```

## Linear Classification

```{r}
#TODO Use what you learned in Module 3 to apply a logistic regression to predict the tumor class using TWO variables


#hint ?glm and ?predict.glm

```

```{r}
#TODO visualize the predictions (first plot) and compare them to the true labels (second plot)
```
